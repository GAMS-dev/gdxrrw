This directory (gdxrrw) contains the files related to the R package
gdxrrw.  Or maybe we'll call the package gams - that remains to be

The subdirectory gdxrrw contains the files that will be used to create
the R package.  For instructions on the steps needed to create the
package, look in the docsInternal subdirectory.  Or maybe they will go
here - we'll have to see what they are first.
