Some helpful commands:
assume $rrw is the dir containing the package tree, i.e. the gdxrrw
directory.

cd $rrw
R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/2.11 gdxrrw
R CMD REMOVE gdxrrw  {to remove, or undo an install}
R CMD check gdxrrw
R CMD build gdxrrw
R CMD build gdxrrw --binary {what we want to avoid user compiling}

> library(gdxrrw)
