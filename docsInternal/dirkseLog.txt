Some helpful commands:
assume $rrw is the dir containing the package tree, i.e. the gdxrrw
directory, or https://svn.gams.com/source/share/gdxrrw in our case.

================ Linux (ike, 64-bit Redhat) ================
Typically we start with
  gg2 alpha ; gup ; gll  (to put a GAMS sysdir in the PATH)
OR
you can have one set via an R .First function
cd $rrw

R CMD INSTALL gdxrrw
R CMD REMOVE gdxrrw  {to remove, or undo an install}
R CMD check gdxrrw

# with R 2.14, R CMD build cannot be used for making binaries, instead
# do:
R CMD INSTALL gdxrrw --build
# to create the binary gdxrrw_X.Y.Z_R_x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu.tar.gz

# to build and check locally
R CMD check gdxrrw ; echo "check rc = $?"

# this command creates a source distribution: gdxrrw_X.Y.Z.tar.gz
R CMD build gdxrrw

-- unneeded/old stuff
# R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/2.13 gdxrrw  no -l needed
# --binary flag no longer supported
# R CMD build gdxrrw --binary {what we want to avoid user compiling}


=========== Windows (adams, Steve's 64-bit Windows 7 desktop at work) ========
# with .libPaths() set to include C:\\R\\2.12 the -l flag is not necessary
# R CMD INSTALL -l C:\R\2.12 gdxrrw
# R CMD REMOVE  -l C:\R\2.12 gdxrrw  {to remove, or undo an install}

# with R 2.14, R CMD build cannot be used for making binaries
# the new "INSTALL pkgname --build" syntax also works with 2.12.1
# R CMD build gdxrrw --binary {what we want to avoid user compiling}

# do these from a normal command prompt, not one started from the
# Visual Studio menu.
R CMD INSTALL gdxrrw
R --no-init-file CMD INSTALL gdxrrw
R CMD REMOVE  gdxrrw    {to remove, or undo an install}
R CMD INSTALL gdxrrw --build   {creates gdxrrw_X.Y.Z.zip for distribution}

-- these didn't work so well
R CMD INSTALL -l C:\R\2.12 --no-multiarch gdxrrw
R --arch=x64 CMD INSTALL -l C:\R\2.12 gdxrrw


================ Mac OSX (what Mac machine will we use?) ================
On OSX multi-arch binaries are built.  This requires the default
compilers in /usr/bin, not the stuff in /usr/local/bin.  Be aware.

R CMD INSTALL gdxrrw
R CMD INSTALL gdxrrw --build
R CMD build gdxrrw && R CMD check gdxrrw_X.Y.Z.tar.gz ; echo "check rc = $?"

# R CMD INSTALL -l ~/Library/R/2.13/library gdxrrw #  no need to set -l


================ Misc ================
> .First <- function() { library(gdxrrw) ; igdx("/home/steve/leg_alpha/gmstest")}
> library(gdxrrw)  but this can go in .First as above
